# [RUNALYZE v4.3.0] Release with minor fixes/changes.

This fork of Runalyze is a release fork with all needed dependencies and can be used directly with [Docker](https://github.com/2er0/runalyze-docker).
I have done some small fixes.
Because it based on the [Release 4.3.0](https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/releases/tag/v4.3.0) i hope it is more future-proof in an "old" docker container.
